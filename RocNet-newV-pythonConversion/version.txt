- You need to use old version of pytorch like 1.12.1:
> conda install pytorch=1.12.1 -c pytorch
Source: 
https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/

- You should add         "leaf_code_size":16 to utils.py

- Remove all .cuda() from ROcNetmodel_32.py fil.

- As torchfold is on github, Install by this format:
> pip install  "git+https://github.com/nearai/torchfold"

- install easyDict ( on piPy) by
> pip install pypi-install  
> pip install  easydict                          


> change "no_cuda": False to "no_cuda": True in util.py and 
also in notebook.


> I changed alot in the original code. Don't mix them only if you should.
